# main.py (Simplified)

# This file can be used for general project setup, running tests, or other utilities.
# It should NOT define a FastAPI app if api.py is your main API entry.

# Example:
# from src.database import init_db
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print("Running general project setup...")
#     init_db() # Ensure database is initialized if not already handled by API startup
#     print("Setup complete. To run the API, use: uvicorn api:app --reload")

# You might keep your original local test scripts here, but ensure they don't interfere
# with the FastAPI app if you decide to merge it into this file.
